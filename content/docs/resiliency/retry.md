## About retries

A retry specifies the maximum number of times {{< reuse "docs/snippets/product-name.md" >}} attempts to connect to an backend service if the initial call fails. Retries can enhance service availability and application performance by making sure that calls donâ€™t fail permanently because of transient problems such as a temporarily overloaded service or network.

To configure retries, you can use the following settings in the RouteOption resource: 
- `options.retries.retryOn` : The condition under which to retry forwarding the request to the backend service. This setting exposes the [`x-envoy-retry-on` Envoy header](https://www.envoyproxy.io/docs/envoy/latest/configuration/http/http_filters/router_filter#x-envoy-retry-on). 
- `options.retries.numRetries`: The number of allowed retries. The default value is 1.  
- `options.retries.perTryTimeout`: The timeout [duration](https://protobuf.dev/reference/protobuf/google.protobuf/#duration) for each retry attempt. This setting exposes the [x-envoy-expected-rq-timeout-ms](https://www.envoyproxy.io/docs/envoy/latest/configuration/http/http_filters/router_filter#x-envoy-expected-rq-timeout-ms) header.

## Set up retries {#retries}
   
Use a RouteOption resource to specify retries for a specific route. 

1. Create a RouteOption custom resource to specify your retry rules. In the following example, the request is retried up to 3 times when a connection failure is detected. For each retry a timeout of 5 seconds is set. 
   ```yaml
   kubectl apply -n httpbin -f- <<EOF
   apiVersion: gateway.kgateway.dev/v1alpha1
   kind: RouteOption
   metadata:
     name: retry
     namespace: httpbin
   spec:
     options:
       retries:
         retryOn: 'connect-failure'
         numRetries: 3
         perTryTimeout: '5s'
   EOF
   ```

2. Create an HTTPRoute resource for the httpbin app that references the RouteOption resource that you created. 
   ```yaml
   kubectl apply -f- <<EOF
   apiVersion: gateway.networking.k8s.io/v1
   kind: HTTPRoute
   metadata:
     name: httpbin-retry
     namespace: httpbin
   spec:
     parentRefs:
     - name: http
       namespace: {{< reuse "docs/snippets/ns-system.md" >}}
     hostnames:
       - retry.example
     rules:
       - filters:
           - type: ExtensionRef
             extensionRef:
               group: gateway.solo.io
               kind: RouteOption
               name: retry
         backendRefs:
           - name: httpbin
             port: 8000
   EOF
   ```

3. Send a request to the httpbin app on the `retry.example` domain. Verify that the request succeeds and that you see a `X-Envoy-Expected-Rq-Timeout-Ms` header. If the header is present, {{< reuse "docs/snippets/product-name.md" >}} expects requests to the httpbin app to succeed within the set timeout. 
   {{< tabs items="LoadBalancer IP address or hostname,Port-forward for local testing" >}}
   {{% tab  %}}
   ```sh
   curl -vik http://$INGRESS_GW_ADDRESS:8080/headers -H "host: retry.example:8080"
   ```
   {{% /tab %}}
   {{% tab %}}
   ```sh
   curl -vik localhost:8080/headers -H "host: retry.example"
   ```
   {{% /tab %}}
   {{< /tabs >}}

   Example output for a successful response: 
   ```console {hl_lines=[12,13]}
   {
    "headers": {
      "Accept": [
        "*/*"
      ],
      "Host": [
        "timeout.example:8080"
      ],
      "User-Agent": [
        "curl/7.77.0"
      ],
      "X-Envoy-Expected-Rq-Timeout-Ms": [
        "5000"
      ],
      "X-Forwarded-Proto": [
        "http"
      ],
      "X-Request-Id": [
        "0ae53bc3-2644-44f2-8603-158d2ccf9f78"
      ]
    }
   }
   ```

4. Optional: Remove the resources that you created. 
   ```sh
   kubectl delete httproute httpbin-retry -n httpbin
   kubectl delete routeoption retry -n httpbin
   ```
